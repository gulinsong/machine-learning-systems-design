# Answer to question 27

**Question 27**

Given only CIFAR-10 dataset, how to build a model to recognize if an image is in the 10 classes of CIFAR-10 or not?

**Answer**

One possible answer: use the method like face recognition, we can train the model use classify net(use loss like arc loss to increase samples' distance between different classes and decrease samples' distance in the same class) or use metric learning method, when test, get embedding of a sample and compute cos distance with 10 classes and get final judgement.
